## What using a proxy?

> The app runs at [this location](https://memnoc.github.io/Quote-Generator/) but it can also run locally on your machine.
> The app uses a Heroku generated [proxy-anywhere](https://github.com/Rob--W/cors-anywhere) type of proxy to by-pass CORS related issue when fetching the API data, and pass headers along with the request.
